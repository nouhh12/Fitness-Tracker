                The Fitness Tracker

The app was developed to calculate the number of calories burned exercising different sports which are: Swimming, Running, Strength Training and Kick Boxing. Each type of activity has a different rate in which the amount of calories burned is calculated, with strength training having the highest rate out of all 4.

Not only does the app display the total amount of calories consumed exercising, but also how much each type of exercise increases the heart rate of the user. Each type of activity also has a different heart rate increase.

Once the user runs the app, a screen with a "Time" field appears where the user should insert the number of minutes done in each exercise. After the user enters all the workout done, the "calculate" button is clicked where another screen is displayed with the total amount of calories burned, total heart rate, as well as the calories burned and heart rate increase of each seperate exercise.
